<h2> HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER</h2>
<p>The debate between the two sides has caused people to make a neutral outcome and combine the two. Companies have made educational apps for learning and even TV shows and movies. Regular people have even took action by making their own You tube videos showing kids how to count, write, read,and even say their ABC's.</p>
<p>This is  positive because its a fun way of teaching kids how to do things, not only does it teach them but it also entertains them and it interest them. It has been proven that if students learn in a way that interests them they have a better chance of doing better at it.</p>
<p>Small children from the ages 2 and up and have shown a great increase in intelligence that some adults don't have. Using these devices they have made them experts in the knowledge of using the device and increased their vocabulary and speech. </p>

  <p>This has also became a negative affect because now kids rely on electronically devices to learn the simples things like counting to five. It also causes some kids to rely on the devices to fall asleep. They also get distracted and start going on off topic videos that have nothing to do with the learning topic. This has been a bad effect because parents have been noticing behavior changes in their children from the acting of the people who play in the You tube shows.</p>
<p>It has been found that children become addicted to the devices and don't even want to participate in outside activities. This can lead to bad social and communication skills.</p>
